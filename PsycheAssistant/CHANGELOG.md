> Android
> - Begun development of security integration, using MMKV for Android specific secure storage.

### 0.0.5:

### 0.0.4:
> General
> - Refactored scoring system so it is more in line with logical use-flow; subtracting and adding scores as one might expect.
> - Added result view and called this from the Survey page when Questions have been answered.

### 0.0.3:

> - Ensured score is updated based on selected value moving forward and backward

> - Various considerations in terms of:
>   - Translation; dynamic vs static
>   - User interface; readability and clarity
>   - Database; local vs external, on-premise vs cloud.
> - Added helper function for converting float to decimal, as this would otherwise not be available in Kotlin, only natively in Java (Android)
